# Spam-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
This project develops a spam detection system using machine learning techniques. It explores data preprocessing, TF-IDF feature extraction, and builds models with Random Forest and SVM classifiers. GridSearchCV is used for hyperparameter tuning. The project compares different approaches to handle class imbalance.
