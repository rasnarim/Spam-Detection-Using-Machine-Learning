## Introduction
Spam detection is a crucial task in natural language processing. This project demonstrates how to preprocess text data and apply machine learning algorithms to detect spam messages effectively. The model built in this project can help in filtering out unwanted spam messages from legitimate ones.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of labeled messages, where each message is either labeled as 'spam' or 'ham'. The dataset is preprocessed to remove any unwanted characters, and then features are extracted using various NLP techniques.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine along with some necessary libraries. You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Here is a list of libraries used in this project:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- nltk
- matplotlib
